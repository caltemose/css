# CSS

This is a starting point with minimal styling I use for personal projects where I have full control of the styling.
The SASS files can be used when I need to extend these styles smartly. For simpler projects where that level of control/flexibility is not needed, the `main.min.css` can be used directly without cloning this repo.

All styling is done to the base tags - there are no classes and no components. There is no grid system as this is meant to be very simple and lightweight.

I am using Roboto as the typeface but that is simple enough to remove or replace if desired. I am only using the normal and bold weights - I have not spec'd the italic typeface mainly because I don't like italics on screen and therefore prefer to avoid the added download of the italic version of the font.

## To Do

- Reorg the styles into `styles/base` or something so when this repo is used within other projects, these base styles are more appropriately organized for living inside that project's source
- Update/improve form styles as needed
